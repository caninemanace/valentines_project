                        <p>My Dearest Abby,

                            From the moment you walked into my life, everything changed in the most beautiful way. <br><br>I find myself smiling more, dreaming bigger, and feeling so incredibly lucky just to know you. You have this way of making even the simplest moments feel special, like the world slows down when I’m with you. <br><br>
                            
                            Every time I see you, my heart skips a beat, and every time I hear your laughter, it’s like the sweetest melody I never want to stop listening to. You are kind, strong, and unbelievably beautiful—not just on the outside, but in all the ways that truly matter. <br><br>
                            
                            On this Valentine’s Day, I just want to remind you how much you mean to me. You are my favorite thought in the morning and my sweetest dream at night. No words could ever fully capture how much I cherish you, but I promise to spend every day showing you just how much you are loved. <br><br>
                            
                            Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. ❤️ <br><br>
                            
                            Forever yours,<br><br>
                            [Bambi] <br><br>
